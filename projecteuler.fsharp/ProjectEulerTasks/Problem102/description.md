## Triangle containment
### Problem 102

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which $-1000 \leq x, y \leq 1000$, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

<p align="center">A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)</p>

<p align="center">X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)</p>

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.

Using [problem_102.dat](../Data/problem_102.dat), a 27K text file containing the co-ordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.
