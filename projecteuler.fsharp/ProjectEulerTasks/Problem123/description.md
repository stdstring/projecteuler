## Prime square remainders
### Problem 123

Let $p_n$ be the $n$<sup>th</sup> prime: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ..., and let $r$ be the remainder when $(p_n−1)^n + (p_n+1)^n$ is divided by $p_n^2$.

For example, when $n = 3$, $p_3 = 5$, and $43 + 63 = 280 \equiv 5{\ }mod{\ }25$.

The least value of $n$ for which the remainder first exceeds 10<sup>9</sup> is 7037.

Find the least value of $n$ for which the remainder first exceeds 10<sup>10</sup>.
