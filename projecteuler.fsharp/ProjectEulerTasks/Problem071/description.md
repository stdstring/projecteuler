## Ordered fractions
### Problem 71

Consider the fraction, $n/d$, where $n$ and $d$ are positive integers. If $n < d$ and $HCF(n,d)=1$, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 8$ in ascending order of size, we get:

<p align="center">
1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, 3/8, <b>2/5</b>, 3/7, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
</p>

It can be seen that 2/5 is the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.

By listing the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 1,000,000$ in ascending order of size, find the numerator of the fraction immediately to the left of 3/7.
