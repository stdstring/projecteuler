## Distinct primes factors
### Problem 47

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

$14 = 2 \times 7$

$15 = 3 \times 5$

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

$644 = 2^2 \times 7 \times 23$

$645 = 3 \times 5 \times 43$

$646 = 2 \times 17 \times 19$.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?
