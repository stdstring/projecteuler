## Digit factorial chains
### Problem 74

The number 145 is well known for the property that the sum of the factorial of its digits is equal to 145:

$1! + 4! + 5! = 1 + 24 + 120 = 145$

Perhaps less well known is 169, in that it produces the longest chain of numbers that link back to 169; it turns out that there are only three such loops that exist:

$169 \to 363601 \to 1454 \to 169$

$871 \to 45361 \to 871$

$872 \to 45362 \to 872$

It is not difficult to prove that EVERY starting number will eventually get stuck in a loop. For example,

$69 \to 363600 \to 1454 \to 169 \to 363601 (\to 1454)$

$78 \to 45360 \to 871 \to 45361 (\to 871)$

$540 \to 145 (\to 145)$

Starting with 69 produces a chain of five non-repeating terms, but the longest non-repeating chain with a starting number below one million is sixty terms.

How many chains, with a starting number below one million, contain exactly sixty non-repeating terms?
