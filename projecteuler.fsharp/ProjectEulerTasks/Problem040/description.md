## Champernowne's constant
### Problem 40

An irrational decimal fraction is created by concatenating the positive integers:

$$\textcolor{black}{0.12345678910}\textcolor{red}{1}\textcolor{black}{112131415161718192021...}$$

It can be seen that the 12<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part is 1.

If d<sub>n</sub> represents the n<sup>th</sup> digit of the fractional part, find the value of the following expression.

$$d_1 \times d_{10} \times d_{100} \times d_{1000} \times d_{10000} \times d_{100000} \times d_{1000000}$$
