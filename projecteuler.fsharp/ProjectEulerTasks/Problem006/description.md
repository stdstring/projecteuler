## Sum square difference
### Problem 6

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,
<p align="center">
<b>1<sup>2</sup> + 2<sup>2</sup> + ... + 10<sup>2</sup> = 385</b>
</p>

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
<p align="center">
<b>(1 + 2 + ... + 10)<sup>2</sup> = 55<sup>2</sup> = 3025</b>
</p>

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is <b>3025 - 385 = 2640</b>.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
