## Maximising a weighted product
### Problem 190

Let $S_m = (x_1, x_2, ... , x_m)$ be the $m$-tuple of positive real numbers with $x_1 + x_2 + ... + x_m = m$ for which $P_m = x_1 * x_2^2 * ... * x_m^m$ is maximised.

For example, it can be verified that $[P{10}] = 4112$ ([ ] is the integer part function).

Find $\sum [P_m]$ for $2 \leq m \leq 15$.
