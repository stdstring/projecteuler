## Triangular, pentagonal, and hexagonal
### Problem 45

Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:

Triangle $T_n=n(n+1)/2$ : 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...

Pentagonal $P_n=n(3n−1)/2$ : 1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...

Hexagonal $H_n=n(2n−1)$ : 1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...

It can be verified that T<sub>285</sub> = P<sub>165</sub> = H<sub>143</sub> = 40755.

Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
