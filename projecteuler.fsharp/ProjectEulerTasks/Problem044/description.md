## Pentagon numbers
### Problem 44

Pentagonal numbers are generated by the formula, $P_n=n(3n−1)/2$. The first ten pentagonal numbers are:

<p align="center">1, 5, 12, 22, 35, 51, 70, 92, 117, 145, ...</p>

It can be seen that P<sub>4</sub> + P<sub>7</sub> = 22 + 70 = 92 = P<sub>8</sub>. However, their difference, 70 − 22 = 48, is not pentagonal.

Find the pair of pentagonal numbers, $P_j$ and $P_k$, for which their sum and difference are pentagonal and $D = | P_k − P_j |$ is minimised; what is the value of $D$?
