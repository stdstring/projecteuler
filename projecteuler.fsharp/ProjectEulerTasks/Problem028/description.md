## Number spiral diagonals
### Problem 28

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:

$$\begin{matrix}
\color{red}{21} & 22 & 23 & 24 & \color{red}{25} \\
20 & \color{red}{7} & 8 & \color{red}{9} & 10 \\
19 & 6 & \color{red}{1} & 2 & 11 \\
18 & \color{red}{5} & 4 & \color{red}{3} & 12 \\
\color{red}{17} & 16 & 15 & 14 & \color{red}{13}
\end{matrix}$$

It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.

What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
