## Coin sums
### Problem 31

In the United Kingdom the currency is made up of pound (£) and pence (p). There are eight coins in general circulation:

<p align="center">1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), and £2 (200p).</p>

It is possible to make £2 in the following way:

$$1 \times £1 + 1 \times 50p + 2 \times 20p + 1 \times 5p + 1 \times 2p + 3 \times 1p$$

How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
