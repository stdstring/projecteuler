## Counting fractions in a range
### Problem 73

Consider the fraction, $n/d$, where $n$ and $d$ are positive integers. If $n < d$ and $HCF(n,d)=1$, it is called a reduced proper fraction.

If we list the set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 8$ in ascending order of size, we get:

<p align="center">
1/8, 1/7, 1/6, 1/5, 1/4, 2/7, 1/3, <b>3/8, 2/5, 3/7</b>, 1/2, 4/7, 3/5, 5/8, 2/3, 5/7, 3/4, 4/5, 5/6, 6/7, 7/8
</p>

It can be seen that there are 3 fractions between 1/3 and 1/2.

How many fractions lie between 1/3 and 1/2 in the sorted set of reduced proper fractions for $d \leq 12,000$?
