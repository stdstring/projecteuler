## Square digit chains
### Problem 92
A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.

For example,

$$44 \to 32 \to 13 \to 10 \to \textbf{1} \to \textbf{1}$$

$$85 \to \textbf{89} \to 145 \to 42 \to 20 \to 4 \to 16 \to 37 \to 58 \to \textbf{89}$$

Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.

How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?
