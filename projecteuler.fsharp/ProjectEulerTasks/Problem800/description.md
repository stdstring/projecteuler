## Hybrid Integers
### Problem 800

An integer of the form $p^qq^p$ with prime numbers $p \neq q$ is called a *hybrid-integer*. For example, $800 = 2^55^2$ is a hybrid-integer.

We define $C(n)$ to be the number of hybrid-integers less than or equal to $n$. You are given $C(800) = 2$ and $C(800^{800}) = 10790$.

Find $C(800800^{800800})$.
