## Reciprocal cycles
### Problem 26

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

$^1/_2 = 0.5$

$^1/_3 = 0.(3)$

$^1/_4 = 0.25$

$^1/_5 = 0.2$

$^1/_6 = 0.1(6)$

$^1/_7 = 0.(142857)$

$^1/_8 = 0.125$

$^1/_9 = 0.(1)$

$^1/_10 = 0.1$

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that $^1/_7$ has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < 1000 for which $^1/_d$ contains the longest recurring cycle in its decimal fraction part.
